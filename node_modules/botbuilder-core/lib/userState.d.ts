 * Reads and writes user state for your bot to storage.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Each user your bot communicates with will have its own isolated storage object that can be used
 * to persist information about the user across all of the conversation you have with that user.
 *
 * Since the `UserState` class derives from `BotState` it can be used as middleware to automatically
 * read and write the bots user state for each turn. And it also means it can be passed to a
 * `BotStateSet` middleware instance to be managed in parallel with other state providers.
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { UserState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');
 *
 * const userState = new UserState(new MemoryStorage());
 * adapter.use(userState);
 *
 * server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
 *    adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
 *       // Get loaded user state
 *       const user = await userState.get(context);
 *
 *       // ... route activity ...
 *
 *    });
 * });
 * ```
