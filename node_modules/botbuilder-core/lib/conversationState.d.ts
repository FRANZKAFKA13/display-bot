/**
 * Reads and writes conversation state for your bot to storage.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Each conversation your bot has with a user or group will have its own isolated storage object
 * that can be used to persist conversation tracking information between turns of the conversation.
 * This state information can be reset at any point by calling [clear()](#clear).
 *
 * Since the `ConversationState` class derives from `BotState` it can be used as middleware to
 * automatically read and write the bots conversation state for each turn. And it also means it
 * can be passed to a `BotStateSet` middleware instance to be managed in parallel with other state
 * providers.
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { ConversationState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');
 *
 * const conversationState = new ConversationState(new MemoryStorage());
 * adapter.use(conversationState);
 *
 * server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
 *    adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
 *       // Get loaded conversation state
 *       const convo = await conversationState.get(context);
 *
 *       // ... route activity ...
 *
 *    });
 * });
 * ```
