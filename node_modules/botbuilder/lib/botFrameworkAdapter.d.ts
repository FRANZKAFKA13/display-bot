     * @remarks
     * The following steps will be taken to process the activity:
     *
     * - The identity of the sender will be verified to be either the Emulator or a valid Microsoft
     *   server. The bots `appId` and `appPassword` will be used during this process and the request
     *   will be rejected if the senders identity can't be verified.
     * - The activity will be parsed from the body of the incoming request. An error will be returned
     *   if the activity can't be parsed.
     * - A `TurnContext` instance will be created for the received activity and wrapped with a
     *   [Revocable Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/revocable).
     * - The context will be routed through any middleware registered with the adapter using
     *   [use()](#use).  Middleware is executed in the order in which it's added and any middleware
     *   can intercept or prevent further routing of the context by simply not calling the passed
     *   in `next()` function. This is called the "Leading Edge" of the request and middleware will
     *   get a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request after the bots logic has run.
     * - Assuming the context hasn't been intercepted by a piece of middleware, the context will be
     *   passed to the logic handler passed in.  The bot may perform an additional routing or
     *   processing at this time. Returning a promise (or providing an `async` handler) will cause the
     *   adapter to wait for any asynchronous operations to complete.
     * - Once the bots logic completes the promise chain setup by the middleware stack will be resolved
     *   giving middleware a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request.
     * - After the middleware stacks promise chain has been fully resolved the context object will be
     *   `revoked()` and any future calls to the context will result in a `TypeError: Cannot perform
     *   'set' on a proxy that has been revoked` being thrown.
     *
     * ```JavaScript
     * server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
     *    // Route received request to adapter for processing
     *    adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
     *        // Process any messages received
     *        if (context.activity.type === 'message') {
